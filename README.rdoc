Qomo is a cloud platform for biological data storage, analysis and sharing. It integrates data and analysis tools in one stop; data is stored in a distributed manner and computations are run in parallel in multiple nodes. By adding more nodes into the cluster, it is capable of accommodating the growing needs of storage and computation.
